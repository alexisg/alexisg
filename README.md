## Development Setup

This project uses Yarn 4.x via Corepack. To get started:

1. Enable Corepack (one-time setup):
   ```bash
   corepack enable
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Run the eleventy JS server:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```


The `postinstall` script will automatically enable Corepack if it's not already enabled.
