In 2015 I was the lead designer and developer of TwitchCon, a stand alone site for Twitch's yearly conference. A self hosted custom version of [Webhook CMS](http;//webhook.com) was used to power the site featuring hundreds of events, guests and exhibitors. Featuring the artwork of [Timothy Reynolds](http://turnislefthome.com/), I art directed the diorama effect seen across the site and used [smoothState.js](https://github.com/miguel-perez/smoothState.js) and css to create a seamless responsive experience.
