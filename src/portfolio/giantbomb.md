In 2011 I joined Giant Bomb and was responsible for the redesign featured in [Time's “50 Websites That Make the Web Great”](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2087815_2087939_2087927,00.html) (although to be fair making the incredible staff and community of GB look great was an easy task). In 2012 Giant Bomb was acquired by CBS Interactive and I was part of a small team tasked with rebuilding the entire site from the ground up. I was the Art Director, one of two lead CSS/SASS developers, and a heavy contributor to our PHP/TWIG templates and video player functions.

Since 2012 I have also participated with [Drew Scanlon](https://twitter.com/drewscanlon) in a yearly [24 Hour Extra Life Marathon](http://www.giantbomb.com/videos/extra-life/?page=6), raising money for [UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland](http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&participantID=237453)[](http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&participantID=237453). The entire staff now participates in the yearly marathons and with efforts from the Giant Bomb community as a whole, we have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years. A special thanks to [Matt Pascual](https://twitter.com/MattPascual) who has done a tremendous job over the last 7 years getting the entire community to rally around this great cause.
