BNET was an original content site produced by CNET Networks aimed to provides managers practical advice for the challenges which they face. The site featured hand draw illustration work, how-to step by step articles and a resource library of common templates and finance information. I collaborated heavily with [Marc Mendell](http://www.marcsdesign.com) our Creative Director, on the launch design of BNET in 2006. In 2010 I led our design efforts to reflect our enhanced industry news and editorial content shift. BNET was eventually merged with CBS Moneywatch after the aquisition of CNET by CBS.
