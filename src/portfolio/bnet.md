BNET was an original content site aimed to provides managers practical advice for the challenges which they face. The site featured hand draw illustration work, how-to step by step articles and a resource library of common templates and finance information. I collaborated heavily with (Marc Mendell[http://www.marcsdesign.com/]) our Creative Director, on the launch design of BNET in 2006. In 2010 I led our design efforts to reflect our enhanced industry news and editorial content shift.
