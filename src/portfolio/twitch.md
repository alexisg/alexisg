#### Twitch Rebrand
In 2019, the brand and product design teams at Twitch worked with our friends over at Collins to re-imagine our brand. The Twitch you see today is the culmination of this amazing work of which I am so proud to have been a part of. You can read more about this incredible transformation on the [Twitch blog](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2019/12/03/beyond-purple/) and [Collins](https://www.wearecollins.com/work/twitch/).

#### Twitch Core UI Design Systems
How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive? Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!"

What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway. Donuts. Is there anything they can't do? Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos.
