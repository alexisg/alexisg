#### Twitch Rebrand
In 2019, the brand and product design teams at Twitch worked with our friends over at Collins to re-imagine our brand. The Twitch you see today is the culmination of this amazing work of which I am so proud to have been a part of. You can read more about this incredible transformation on the [Twitch blog](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2019/12/03/beyond-purple/) and [Collins](https://www.wearecollins.com/work/twitch/).

#### Twitch Core UI Design Systems
The foundation of our product designs is built around our Design Systems named Core UI. Core UI exists as our source of truth for our design language, Figma component system, and React based front end framework. I led the creation of Core UI in 2015 as an intiative to create a shared method for designers to work and talk about design and also bring a cohesive system to our applications.
